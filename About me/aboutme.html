    <p>Hey yo, what's up? My name is Josue Molina, I was born and raised in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. I served a mission in 
        the Ecuador Quito North Mission, I really enjoyed those two years, I learned how to love the people that I served and
        came back amazed with all the astonishing views of volcanoes covered by snow.

        I have always loved computers and rapidly became interested on how in the world they could do so much, that's why I'm 
        majoring in Computer Science. I love the Fall semester by a lot of reasons, like the rain, the color of the leaves, the 
        weather, and Halloween, I'm really excited to be here with you guys, I hope we all can achieve a lot in this course and 
        whatever lies ahead of us.
